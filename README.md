# Rutgers-CS

This repository contains my solutions to programming assignments for the courses I've taken at Rutgers. All code is original; any assignments that included drivers, classes, or any other code written by professors is not included here so as not to take credit for their work.

<h2>CS211: Computer Architecture</h2>

<b>PA1:</b> 9 short programs that emulate basic operations and data structures in C.

<b>PA2:</b> A 16x16 hexadoku solver (<b>first</b> and <b>second</b>) and a least-squares regression calculator (<b>third</b>).

<b>PA4:</b> Simulates a cache with prefetching and FIFO/LRU replacement policies.

<b>PA5:</b> Simulates a circuit with binary gates (AND, OR, etc), decoders, and multiplexers.
